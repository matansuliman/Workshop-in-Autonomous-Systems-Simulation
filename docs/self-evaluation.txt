Self Evaluation: This project is far from perfect and here is a guideline how to make it that way

    - Timeout: trigger functions
        - time based: limit elapsed time since the simulation started
        - detection based: limit elapsed time since last detection of the platform
        - Catch-up: stuck or not closing the gap for a certain duration
        - Landing attempts: limit failover attempts

    - Decoupling: some of the files are not decupled from MuJoCo API
        - Environment
        - Camera Streamer

    - Configuration:
        - GUI can be improved to alter PID gains, timeout thresholds, noise parameters...

    - Realism:
        - noise: can add drift and drift rate
        - prediction: add weight to prediction, more detections -> higher confidence
        - drone controller: face the direction of motion
        - pad controller: add velocity in z axis and introduce acceleration

    - Extensions:
        - class Log: time as x-axis and multiple y-axis, can plot itself
        - class Drone: easier to swap models or run multiple instances
        - class ConfigProfile: have multiple yaml files
